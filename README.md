# Workday-Scheduler
This application helps users with time-management and task scheduling so they can be better organised through work days.
The User-Interface is simple and the User-Experience is smooth. Users can easily log in their daily tasks ahead and keep
track with a mere glance. This ease of use is based on the colour theme of the app where indicative colours are used to 
show the user their status quo.

See [link](https://contentcommando.github.io/Workday-Scheduler/) to the application.

## Specific Features
1. The app displays the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

2. Timeblocks for standard business hours are shown as user scrolls down.

3. Theme colours are used to distinguish between past, present, and future hours.

4. The app allows users to input tasks for any given business hour(s) of the day within the
timeblocks and such is saved in local storage when the "save button" is clicked.

## Tools Deployed
1. **HTML** for building structure, along with Bootstrap components.
2. **CSS** for styling.
3. **Javascript** for dynamically accessing and developing API/DOM environment.
4. **Day.js** for date and time functionality
5. **J-Query** for developing and enabling critical functional components of the app.

## Future
1. To further improve the UI for a more professional look and feel. Rework the save icon to be centralised within the main button.

2. To add a notification that user task input has been saved.

## Lessons
Working in the DOM environment with Javascript and familiarising with the use of 3rd party APIs and Jquery. Looking critically at documentations and learning from available online samples of similar projects.
